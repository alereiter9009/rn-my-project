When displaying content, run into issue with the layout of views. Found out the default behaviour of react-native is column as opposed to row. 
Struggled in resizing image to fit the desired view, found out a way around it by defining width and height "null" and resizeMode "stretch".

When coding the MainInfoScreen that worked with an API, couldn't manage to display the data properly. Had to google it to find out i needed to use JSON.stringify.Also had to make a few changed to the fetch method with the use of react hooks.  
Had to research how to apply multiple inline styles to Text components, learned the concept of nesting them with the desired styling. 
stackNavigator wasn't working after having worked in the past, research to find out there was an update and its name changed. Uninstalled everything and installed, updated the names to fix the issue. 
Had to research how to style stackNavigatorHeader, found out I was using the wrong object name. 
Had to research how to redirect user to URL links on default browser, found out the best way was using Linking method. 
Had to create a customised component in order to decrease the amount of typed code, passing props proved to be tricky at first. 
Unfortunately I was unable to find an API that would supply me with the data that I am looking for, for the remaining two screens of my app called CultureAspects and FunFacts. Had to research a database to use in order to fetch such data and display it on those screens. 
Has struggled to manage to create an appropriate formatted JSON file in order to import data to database. Reading the documentation as well as using a json formatter tool coupled by using a website for JSON parsing helped me solve that issue.
